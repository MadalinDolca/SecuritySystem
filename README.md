# 🛡️ Security System

Within this project I built a simple PI security system that takes photos upon detecting any movement through a motion/proximity sensor and a web camera. The photos are triggered only if a switch is turned on, and when the photo is taken an LED lights up. The pictures are stored in the board's internal memory, following a socket to send the data in a web interface provided by the Flask server.
